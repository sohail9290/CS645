2. At the end of Day 1, a snapshot of all contents on the platform is taken. Data in the snapshot
is then Merkle-hashed using Ascon-Hash, resulting in a hash value 𝐻# . 𝐻# together with #""
𝐻! is then hashed to produce 𝐻", that is 𝐻" = 𝑎𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑛_h𝑎𝑠h(𝐻!, 𝐻"). Publish 𝐻" to the entire
world by, for example, announcing it on Twitter or a widely distributed newspaper.
